Description: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X
  and rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could only be done by
  binding the two matrices together and calling 'dist', but this creates
  unnecessary computation by computing the distances between a row of X
  and another row of X, and likewise for Y.
